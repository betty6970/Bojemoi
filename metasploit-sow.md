# Statement of Work (SOW)
## Metasploit Module Analyzer Service

### 1. Introduction

This Statement of Work (SOW) outlines the implementation and deployment of the Metasploit Module Analyzer Service, a Python-based application designed to analyze, categorize, and provide insights into Metasploit exploit modules using machine learning techniques. The service will operate as a background service on Alpine Linux and expose functionality through a REST API.

### 2. Scope of Work

#### 2.1. Overview
The contractor shall develop, implement, and deploy a service that analyzes Metasploit modules to categorize them, extract useful patterns, and provide a question-answering system to help users understand module functionality and characteristics. The service will use machine learning to classify modules based on their content, extract key features, and generate insights.

#### 2.2. Objectives
1. Develop a system that automatically analyzes Metasploit modules and categorizes them
2. Implement machine learning algorithms to classify modules by type
3. Create a knowledge extraction system that identifies patterns in module design
4. Build a Q&A system to answer questions about specific modules
5. Provide a REST API for interacting with the analysis service
6. Deploy the service as a background daemon on Alpine Linux

#### 2.3. Technical Requirements

The contractor shall:

* Implement a Python-based service using Flask for the REST API
* Use scikit-learn for machine learning components
* Implement the following machine learning algorithms:
  * TF-IDF Vectorization for text processing
  * Random Forest Classifier for module type prediction
  * Multinomial Naive Bayes for question classification
* Process and extract structured information from Ruby (.rb) files
* Implement reliable model persistence and loading mechanisms
* Create a daemon service installable via Alpine Linux's init system
* Implement robust error handling and logging
* Ensure performance with proper multithreading for training operations

* Classification of question types
* Response generation based on module information

#### 4.5. REST API
* Health check and status endpoints
* Module listing and details endpoints
* Question answering endpoint
* Training and model management endpoints
* Statistics and rule retrieval endpoints

### 5. Implementation Timeline

   * Performance optimization
   * API documentation

4. **Phase 4: Handover & Documentation** (1 week)
   * Final documentation creation
   * Knowledge transfer
   * Deployment support

### 6. Technical Specifications

#### 6.1. Programming Language & Libraries
* Python 3.6+
* Flask for web framework
* Scikit-learn for machine learning
* Pandas for data manipulation
* Numpy for numerical processing
* Waitress for production-ready WSGI serving

#### 6.2. API Specifications
* RESTful JSON API
* Endpoint documentation available at /api
* Health/status checks at /api/health
* Module data available at /api/modules
* Q&A functionality at /api/ask
* Model management at /api/train and /api/reload
* Rules and statistics at /api/rules and /api/stats

#### 6.3. Model Persistence
* Models stored in specified models_dir location
* Timestamped model versions with symlink to latest
* Automatic loading of most recent model on startup

#### 6.4. Service Installation
* Runnable as standalone Python application
* Installable as a system service via init scripts
* Proper logging to both console and file (/var/log/metasploit-analyzer.log)

### 7. Maintenance and Support

The contractor shall provide:

1. Bug fixes and critical updates for a period of 3 months after final delivery
2. Documentation on model retraining procedures
3. Instructions for service updates and maintenance
4. Code comments and documentation to support future development

### 8. Acceptance Criteria

The work will be deemed complete and acceptable when:

1. The service can successfully parse and analyze Metasploit modules
2. Machine learning models achieve at least 80% accuracy on module classification
3. The REST API is fully functional with all specified endpoints
4. The service can be installed and run as a background daemon
5. All documentation is complete and accurate
6. Code passes quality review and includes appropriate error handling
7. The system can retrain models on new modules as they become available

### 9. Assumptions and Constraints

1. The system will be deployed on Alpine Linux
2. Metasploit modules will be available in a format consistent with the current Metasploit Framework
3. Hardware requirements:
   * Minimum 2GB RAM for service operation
   * Minimum 4GB RAM recommended for model training
   * 500MB disk space for code and models
4. Network requirements:
   * API will be accessible via HTTP on the configured port (default 5000)
   * Only local access is assumed; security considerations for public access are out of scope

### 10. Project Management
